# Basic Authentication Api
This is a simple authentication API made with Expressjs.

I was making the same thing again and again so I decided to make a basic api which I/anyone can reuse later on.

## Things Used:
  - [Expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
  - [Postgresql for Database](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session)
  - [cookie-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser)
  - [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors)
  - [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex)
  - [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres)
  - [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/)
